    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>In the cloud storage industry, there are no storage of options. However, this is the story of the Cirrus. I was entrusted to create a cloud storage app. I was tasked with researching and identifying a target market that would benefit from a
      new cloud storage solution and bring a new, unique cloud storage to market.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <img src="images/problemicon.png" alt="problem">
    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>My role in this project was to create a cloud storage app that challenges competitors. Despite the vast amount of competition, this design allows users such as collaboration, organization, upload files and sharing amongst friends, family and
      coworkers.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="solution">
    <img src="images/solutionicon.png" alt="solution">
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>The solution is Cirrus. Cirrus is a cloud storage and multi - purpose of Cirrus with a focus on organization that provides creative with convenient solution also bringing in a new perspective. Cirrus has the fun flexibility of document and
      managing real time collaboration, organization and upload files in one single place.</p>

    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
    <p>The project was kicked off by conducting competitive analysis of key market competitors consisting of Google drive, Drop Box , and oneDrive. Through this analysis, I found weaknesses in the market, an analysis of their weaknesses presented an
      opportunity to create unique feature to this new cloud storage solution.</p>

      sharing,
      a page where files are located, the upload. After sketching a few iterations from the user flow. I started working on digital wireframes in figma.</p>

      signing up for account. Each user had no problem signing up for account. They were able to Upload and shared new file, however i received feedback from users so i decided to include icons to make it more visually</p>

    <p>Brainstorming and research tells us the first clouds that most everyone sees on a daily basis are the Cirrus Clouds. After researching the different clouds i came to the conclusion that the Cirrus Cloud is the most common cloud seen. It was
      chosen for its simplicity. It is soft and unobtrusive more like a pillow almost inviting you to lay down, relax. Unlike a storm cloud that may strike fear into the observer. It is their ice crystal build up at sunset and sunrise causes us to
      see those gorgeous colors. The Earth is were we all live and we also know the sky where the Cirrus Clouds reside is infinite. Therefore our storage space is limitless.</p>

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <p>Choosing the “Typeface” was indeed a little more challenging, but I finally settled on the Lora Bold and Roboto slab. The typography for the word CIRRUS uses Lora. I also wanted to incite emotions such as trust, vibrant, inspired, creative.
      The Lora, Roboto Slab Typeface is clean, something that was indeed appealing to and going to attract all comers.
      Lora Bold represent the creativity and fluidity of the brand.</p>

      with everyone, I also wanted the colors to be vibrant in order to catch the user’s attention but also stand out.</p>

  <div class="Conclusion">
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>This was an interesting project for me. Reflecting on the conclusion of the project, I believe that cirrus is a great alternative to other cloud services. The research done in this project to create a bigger better cloud service then what is
      already on the market taught me just how important research is. Initially I was very worried because this was my first project. Not everything worked in the design process. Before the project even started, i had doubts about how this was
      going
      to differentiate from other popular cloud storage services, already on the market. Research showed me some of the differences and unveiled some of their flaws. In my opinion research is indeed an invaluable tool. Through the course of this
      project i've been able to distinguish key metrics for a successful cloud storage.</p>
