           <h5>Here’s a little bit about me…</h5>
           <p>Hi! I’m Kamala, and I’m a UX Designer.</p><br>
           <p>I’m a detail-oriented designer and a great listener.  I query every aspect of a design problem to make sure there’s a reason behind every design decision I make.</p><br>
          <p>I also spend time reading and absorbing information about design and design-thinking.  My reflections have led me to affirm that the process of design and designing with users in mind can get tremendously messy and is full of uncertainties and potential dead-ends.  I believe a good designer is one that cultivates fearlessness and open mindedness.  A good designer isn’t afraid to fail, to experiment with different approaches - to “fail fast” as the saying goes, and to constantly reflect on past experiences as a window into constant growth and improvement.</p><br>
           <p>I came from a medical background, which might at first seem highly unusual for someone passionate about design.  But my experiences within the field of medicine have trained me to be observant, to listen carefully and with compassion and empathy to my clients and patients, and really understand where they are coming from both from a pragmatic and emotional standpoint.  Design is no different. Trying to understand the client and user’s needs, both those they articulate and are sometimes unable to articulate is what makes for good design. I’m passionate about creating useful, and beautiful products that help people and make a difference.</p><br>
           <p>So, I enrolled in Bloc Programs to study and explore UX further through a Bloc apprenticeship. The hands-on training and expertise of their teachers has opened up new horizons in my career. My dreams of helping people through technology have become a reality. I believe that technology can revolutionize how people learn, communicate and create. I love working with people to determine their needs and bring their ideas to life.</p><br>
