    <h5>Here‚Äôs a little bit about me‚Ä¶</h5>
    <p>Hi there üëã I‚Äôm Kamala, a UX/UI Designer.</p><br>
    <p>I am a detail-oriented designer and an active listener. I query every aspect of a design problem to make sure that there is a reason behind every design decision that I make.</p><br>
    <p>I also spend plenty of time reading and absorbing information about design and the conceptualization of it. My reflections have led me to believe that the process of conceptualizing a design and designing with users in mind can get
      tremendously complicated and is full of uncertainties as well as potential dead-ends. I believe that a good designer is one who demonstrates fearlessness and open-mindedness. A good designer is not afraid to fail, is ready to experiment with
      different approaches - to ‚Äúfail fast‚Äù as the saying goes, and constantly reflects on past experiences to achieve constant growth and improvement.</p><br>
    <p>I came from a medical background, something which might seem highly unusual at first for someone who is passionate about design. However, my experiences within the field of medicine have trained me to be observant, to listen carefully with
      compassion, to show empathy to my clients and patients, and to try to understand where they are coming from both from a pragmatic and emotional standpoint. I am going to use my experience or Design to make the web a better place by trying to
      understand the needs and preferences of the clients and users regarding what a good design is for them, regardless if they can articulate these things or not.</p><br>
    <p>What brought me to UX Design is that I want to pursue my dream of helping the people through technology which has become a reality. I believe that technology can revolutionize how people learn, communicate, and create. I love working with
      people to determine their needs and bring their ideas to life. They are my inspiration. Thus, I enrolled in Bloc Programs to study and explore UX further through a Bloc apprenticeship. The hands-on training and expertise of their teachers has
      opened new horizons in my career. I am confident that this is the right move towards pursuing my passion which is creating useful and beautiful products that help people and make a difference in their lives.</p><br>
